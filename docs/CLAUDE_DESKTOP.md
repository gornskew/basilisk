# Claude Desktop Integration (Linux, macOS, Windows)

How to point Claude Desktop at a running Basilisk, so it can drive the
Emacs and Common Lisp images aboard as MCP tools.

This lives in the Basilisk repo rather than in `skewed-emacs` because the
config being generated registers **every** server on the roster —
`skewed-emacs`, `gendl-ccl`, `gendl-sbcl`, and whatever the overlays add.
No single crew member's repo can write that file, because none of them
knows what else is aboard.

## Prerequisites

- Docker running (Docker Desktop on macOS/Windows, Docker Engine on Linux)
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed
- Basilisk cloned and a stack started at least once (see the main README)
- Windows only: [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
  with Docker Desktop using the WSL2 backend

## Setup

1. **Start the stack** (if not already running):

   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/basilisk
   ./basilisk up
   ```

   Wait for the `[SUCCESS] Claude Desktop config ready` message.
   `basilisk` detects your platform and writes the appropriate config to
   `mcp/claude_desktop_config.json` — on Linux and macOS it invokes
   `mcp/mcp-exec` directly; on Windows it goes through `wsl`.

2. **Copy the generated config to Claude Desktop's config location:**

   **Linux:**
   ```bash
   cp mcp/claude_desktop_config.json ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   **macOS:**
   ```bash
   cp mcp/claude_desktop_config.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   **Windows (from inside WSL):**
   ```bash
   cp mcp/claude_desktop_config.json /mnt/c/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your Windows username. Alternatively,
   from Windows Explorer:
   - Source: `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\YOUR_WSL_USER\projects\basilisk\mcp\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Destination: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** — you should see the roster's MCP servers
   connect:
   - `skewed-emacs` — Emacs Lisp evaluation
   - `gendl-sbcl` — Common Lisp (SBCL) with Gendl
   - `gendl-ccl` — Common Lisp (CCL) with Gendl

   (Plus any additional backends from overlay repos you have installed.)

4. **Optional — prime your first session**: paste the contents of
   [`mcp/opening-prompt.md`](../mcp/opening-prompt.md) as your first
   message so the agent bootstraps itself with the environment.

## Daily Usage

The stack must be running for Claude Desktop to use the MCP servers:

```bash
cd ~/projects/basilisk
./basilisk up -d   # -d for daemon mode (no interactive shell)
```

To stop it:

```bash
cd ~/projects/basilisk
./basilisk down
```

## What You Can Do

With these MCP servers, Claude Desktop can:

- Evaluate Emacs Lisp code and interact with the Emacs environment
- Evaluate Common Lisp code in SBCL or CCL
- Work with the Gendl geometry kernel for CAD/knowledge-based engineering
- Access documentation and run HTTP requests against the backend services

## Bootstrapping a Session

Optional but recommended: create a Claude Desktop Project and paste
[`PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](https://github.com/gornskew/skewed-emacs/blob/master/docs/PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
into its custom instructions, so every session starts with the
dashboard/daily-focus routine and safe editing conventions. The same text
works in a Claude Code `CLAUDE.md` or Codex `AGENTS.md`. For a one-shot
alternative, paste [`../mcp/opening-prompt.md`](../mcp/opening-prompt.md)
as your first message.

## Other MCP Clients

Claude Desktop is just one consumer. The same generated configs work for:

- **Claude Code**: from the Basilisk clone, `claude mcp add` each server
  from `mcp/claude_desktop_config.json`, or copy its `mcpServers` block
  into a `.mcp.json` in your project
- **Codex CLI**: `./basilisk up` maintains `~/.codex/config.toml` inside
  the container automatically; for a host-side Codex, adapt `mcp/mcp.toml`
- **Grok Build CLI**: the same merged TOML is written into
  `~/.grok/config.toml` (`[mcp_servers.*]`); launch with `grokly` from a
  shell inside the full/aituis image
- **Any MCP-capable client**: point it at `mcp/mcp-exec` with the args
  shown in `mcp/claude_desktop_config.json`

## Merging with Existing MCP Configuration

If you already have other MCP servers configured in Claude Desktop, merge
the `mcpServers` entries from the generated `claude_desktop_config.json`
into your existing configuration file by hand.

## Cloning to a Different Location

The generated `claude_desktop_config.json` contains the absolute path to
your **Basilisk** clone, determined at `./basilisk up` time from where you
run the command, so a non-default clone location works automatically.

This is also the failure mode to watch for after the 2026-08-15 repo
split. A config generated before the split points at
`…/skewed-emacs/mcp/mcp-exec`, which no longer exists; the servers then
fail to start with nothing obviously wrong in Claude Desktop's UI. If MCP
went quiet around an upgrade, check that path first and re-copy the
freshly generated file.

## Troubleshooting

**MCP servers not connecting:**
- Ensure the stack is running (`docker ps` should show the containers)
- Check that the paths in `claude_desktop_config.json` match your Basilisk
  clone location — see the note above about pre-split configs
- Restart Claude Desktop after copying the config

**`mcp/claude_desktop_config.json` missing or stale:**
- It is generated; run `./basilisk up` and wait for the
  `[SUCCESS] Claude Desktop config ready` message
- If the message doesn't appear, the Emacs daemon may still be starting —
  run `./basilisk up` again

**"emacsclient not ready" warning on first start:**
- This is normal — the Emacs daemon takes a few seconds to initialize
- Run `./basilisk up` again and the MCP config will generate successfully
