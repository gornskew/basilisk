;;; Usage: (load "/projects/skewed-emacs/generate-configs.el")
;;;        (skewed-generate-all-configs)
;;;
;;; Or from command line:
;;;   emacs --batch -l generate-configs.el -f skewed-generate-all-configs
;;;
;;; For overlays (non-skewed-emacs directories), also generates install script.
;;;
;;; This generator reads ONE basilisk.sexp and outputs configs.
;;; Overlay behavior is handled at runtime:
;;;   - Docker Compose: native multi-file merge (-f base.yml -f overlay.yml)
;;;   - MCP configs: merged at startup via mcp/merge-configs.sh
;;;   - Install script: auto-generated for overlays (non-empty prefix);;; This generator reads ONE basilisk.sexp and outputs configs.

reads .env FIRST, where generate-env.sh has written the dev port unless
it inherited a value.  So the overlay's own default never gets a chance:
the ingress moves to 19069 and every property behind it goes dark.  That
is the 2026-08-16 outage, and it happened because this generator emitted
an install script that wrote only the image variant into host.env -- the
one channel ./basilisk and basilisk.service both read before generating.

The ingress is found BY PROPERTY (:type \"reverse-proxy\"), never by its
service name: the name is a posting, postings get renamed (pilot ->
transporter-chief), and a name match here would silently drop the :80
pin on the next rename -- re-running the 2026-08-16 outage with a fresh
